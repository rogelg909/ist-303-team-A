 ### Future Enhancements (Post-IST303 Module Roadmap)

While not part of the current course implementation, the following ideas were considered for future development to expand CodeQuest's learning experience:

- **Timer-Based Mode** – Introduce time-limited questions for increased challenge.  
- **Hints Per Question** – Offer optional hints to reinforce learning before submission.  
- **Progress Tracking Dashboard** – Let users view their quiz history and improvement trends.  
- **Flashcard Review Mode** – Provide a passive review experience with question flashcards.  
- **Sound Effects** – Add feedback sounds for correct/incorrect responses.  
- **Adaptive Difficulty System** – Dynamically adjust question difficulty based on performance.  
- **Gamification Features** – Incorporate badges, levels, or streaks to motivate consistent usage.  

> These enhancements are beyond the scope of the current IST 303 course but represent valuable directions for future iterations of the app.

- **Planned Enhancements Deferred**: Flashcards, adaptive difficulty, and sound effects moved to future pipeline.
- **Burndown Chart Informed Adjustments**: Timeline was adjusted as actual workdays slightly extended in Iteration 3.
- **Testing Prioritized**: Pytest coverage and CI automation were established ahead of final submission.
- **Modular Milestones**: Work was structured around milestone check-ins, allowing progressive delivery and review.

## How To Run Test & Check Coverage

1. **Run all test cases using Pytest:**
   pytest -v
   
2. **Check coverage (optional)**
   pip install pytest-cov
   pytest --cov=.
   
3. **CI/CD via GitHub Actions:
   - actions.yml is location in .github/workflows/
   - Automatically triggers tests on every push to main

---

## Three Most Important Things We Learned

- **Agile development** helped us manage an evolving scope and respond effectively to late-stage client feature requests (e.g., custom quiz generation).
  
- **Flask session handling and routing logic** required careful synchronization between frontend templates and backend view functions, especially during toggling answer visibility and managing quiz flows.

- **GitHub Actions** ensured reliable continuous integration by automatically running test cases with Pytest before merging, helping us maintain code quality and deployment readiness.

## GitHub Usage & Project Management

We utilized GitHub effectively throughout the project:

- **Commit History**: Frequent and consistent commits reflecting real-time progress.
- **Collaboration**: All team members contributed via feature branches and pull requests.
- **Issue Tracking**: GitHub Issues were used to log bugs and track new feature requests.
- **Milestones**: Key milestones like "Milestone 2.0" and final delivery were tracked.
- **Project Boards**: Kanban-style GitHub Project Board was used for backlog and task planning.
- **Automated Testing**: CI configured with **GitHub Actions** to run tests via **Pytest** on every push.
- **Requirements File**: Managed dependencies via `requirements.txt` for easy setup and reproducibility.
- **YAML Workflow**: `.github/workflows/actions.yml` handles auto-testing pipelines.
