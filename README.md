## 📅 Updated 10-12 Week Development Timeline

| **Week**   | **Task**|
|----------- | ----------|
| **Week 1** | Define project scope, finalize user stories, set up the development environment, and assign team roles. |
| **Week 2** | Implement basic quiz functionality: question display, answer input, and basic flow control. |
| **Week 3** | Improve the quiz format for a better user experience: clear formatting, structured output, and validation of answers. |
| **Week 4** | Add multiple-choice support, implement score tracking, and test initial quiz flow. |
| **Week 5** | Implement robust error handling: manage invalid inputs, implement retry prompts, and refine answer validation logic. |
| **Week 6** | Store quiz questions in an external file (JSON or TOML), allow dynamic loading, and develop an admin panel for quiz management. |
| **Week 7** | Introduce **hints**, **question explanations**, and **randomization of questions** for enhanced replayability. |
| **Week 8** | Implement **timer-based quiz mode**, **flashcard mode**, and refine question selection logic. |
| **Week 9** | Add **leaderboard functionality**, **user progress tracking**, and **quiz history storage**. |
| **Week 10** | Debug, optimize code structure, and refactor using functions and object-oriented design for maintainability. |
| **Week 11** | Conduct **comprehensive user testing**, gather feedback, and fix reported issues. |
| **Week 12** | Final deployment, documentation, and preparation for future expansion. |

## 🔄 Adjustments & Considerations:
- **Increased focus on error handling & UX improvements (Weeks 5-7).**
- **Extended development time (10-12 weeks instead of 8-10 weeks) to accommodate testing and iterations.**
- **Early implementation of dynamic quiz management (Week 6) ensures flexibility for future enhancements.**
- **Feature prioritization: Core quiz mechanics first, followed by enhancements.**
- **Week 11 allocated for thorough testing and bug fixes before final deployment.**
