# Part D: Milestone 2.0 Final Report

## 1. Milestone 2.0 Team Presentation

Each team member contributed to a clear and structured class presentation demonstrating our completed features, architecture, and responsibilities. Live demo segments included:

- Student perspective: quiz interaction, leaderboard updates, and explanations toggle.
- Teacher perspective: admin panel access, quiz generation by topic/difficulty, export to PDF, and email delivery.

---

##  2. Working Code & Milestone Scope

### a. Working Code Demo

The app demonstrates:

- Functional registration/login for both students and teachers (with teacher code).
- Dynamic quiz with category/topic filters, scoring, and explanations.
- Leaderboard tracking top scores by quiz category.
- Teacher-only admin panel for managing quiz questions.
- PDF export and quiz email functionality for teachers.
- Toggle answers visibility during preview.

---

### b. Explanation of Milestone 2.0 Functionality

Milestone 2.0 focused on delivering key user stories:

1. **As a student**, I want to register and login.
2. **As a student**, I want to select quiz categories and view explanations.
3. **As a student**, I want to track my scores and see a leaderboard.
4. **As a teacher**, I want to register with a secret code and login securely.
5. **As a teacher**, I want to manage quiz questions via an admin panel.
6. **As a teacher**, I want to generate quizzes based on topic, difficulty, and limit.
7. **As a teacher**, I want to preview the quiz and control whether answers are visible.
8. **As a teacher**, I want to export the quiz to PDF and email it to myself.

### c. Agile Methodology & Burndown Chart

We followed Agile using 2-week sprints. Iteration progress was tracked internally via milestone sheets and burndown charts.

### d. Testing Approach and Coverage

- **Manual Testing:** All major user flows including login, quiz attempts, admin panel, and exports were manually tested.
- **Automated Testing:** 
  - Pytest used for testing login, role-based access, quiz logic, and validation.
  - ~80% coverage via CLI output and terminal logs.

```bash
pytest
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing

CI/CD Integration: GitHub Actions automatically runs tests on every push to main.

### e. Key Successes, Failures & Lessons Learned

#### Successes:
- Delivered client-requested features (quiz preview, PDF export, emailing).
- Role-based access control for teachers and students.
- Clean and functional UI using Bootstrap.
- Working automated test workflow via GitHub Actions.

#### Failures:
- Login/session logic required extra time to debug early on.
- PDF generation initially had formatting issues.

#### Lessons Learned:
- UI/UX polishing is more time-consuming than expected.
- Translating vague client ideas into specific user stories is crucial.
- Dividing logic into small reusable components (modular functions) improves testability.
